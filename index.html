                <h3>Beef Cashewnut Salad</h3>
                <p>A robust, filling salad, ideal for a warm summers day or evening. The secret lies in cooking the meat
                    correctly, therefore do read the instructions carefully. Season the steaks with Chilli & Garlic
                    Seasoning, drizzle and turn in olive oil.
                    Leave at room temperature for 20-30 minutes (the Chef’s term for this is ‘tempering the meat’, it
                    ensures flavour absorbance and even cooking.)

                <h3>Dessert</h3>
                <p>Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course consists of sweet foods, such as
                    confections, and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine and liqueur. In some parts of the world,
                    such as much of central and western Africa, and most parts of China, there is no tradition of a
                    dessert course to conclude a meal.</p>

                <h3>Fruit Salad</h3>
                <p>The perfect fruit salad for a backyard bbq or any occasion. There are never leftovers! This is one of
                    my favorite fruit salad recipes, as I think the sauce really makes it. This salad is tastier the
                    longer you can let it soak in its juices. I prefer 3 to 4 hours in the refrigerator before I serve
                    it. Pour the cooled sauce over the fruit. Cover and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours before serving.
